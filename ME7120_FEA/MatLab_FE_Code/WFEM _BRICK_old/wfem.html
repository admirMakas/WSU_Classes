Wright Finite Element Method (WFEM) is designed to be an
easily extensible research-oriented structural finite element code.
The design concept is that all ``parts'' of the model are actions by
external codes. The central finite element code knows nothing about
any particular element or boundary condition type. It depends on a
completely self-capable code for implementing the ``method'' of the
element or boundary condition. The advantage of this approach is that
the code is able to handle the introduction of new elements without
any modification of existing parts of the package. Further, additional
capabilities can be added to elements without disruption to the main
body of the code.

<p>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc1">
1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Anatomy of the body of the code</h2>
The main body of FEM is currently under construction, and likely will
be indefinitely. In terms of performing analysis, this is not all that
bad, since the real work of the code is handled internally to the
element codes. The ability to find mode shapes and natural
frequencies, plot deflections, and find stresses are separate aspects
from the main body, and are performed by the element codes.

     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.1">
1.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Linear Dynamic Analysis</h3>
Finding mode shapes and natural frequencies of a linear model can be
performed using  which uses Cholesky decomposition
of the mass matrix and assumes nothing about the stiffness matrix,
K, in terms of symmetry. However, no asymmetric capabilities have
been added yet (the FEM code doesn't have the ability to make an
asymmetric element).

     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.2">
1.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Guyan Reduction</h3>
Guyan reduction of the model can be easily performed using
. In the automatic mode, it will remove DOFs with a
mass/stiffness below a predefined threshold.

     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.3">
1.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Plotting</h3>
The ability to be plotted is one that is defined internally to an
element (See section ). The plotting routine knows
nothing about elements, only about nodes, their locations, and how
they are connected (via lines, surfaces...). Lines and patches are
defined by what nodes they connect, not by geometry. Plotting of modes
is easily accomplished by adding mode shapes to the undeformed nodal
location, and plotting all predefined nodes, lines, and patches.

     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.4">
1.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Plotting Stresses/Strains (Not completed)</h3>
Plotting stresses and strains is accomplishes by using the
 and  matrices. These are actually
stresses and strain levels corresponding to the appropriate lines and
patches and are placed in those matrices at the correct locations by
the appropriate element code.

 <h2><a name="tth_sEc2">
2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering data</h2>
For the sake of ease of use, is best to define nodes and element property types before elements are defined. An example input code is listed as follows:<br />
<a name="listing:example.txt">
</a>A simple truss example, example.txt. ]example.txt
The first thing that one notices about the file is that the '%' can
be used to add comments throughout the file, at any location, even in
the middle of data. The '%' must reside in the first column for the
comment to be recognized as a comment character.

<p>
Properties are defined after the `element properties' line. Some
flexibility is allowed for typographical errors, but this flexibility
shouldn't be exploited for poetic license. Each type of element can
have its own method for defining element properties. Elements can also
have multiple methods of data input. For example, it would be quite
reasonable to allow for a beam element that has constant properties
along its length. As a result, only 7 entries, <font face="symbol">r</font
>, A, I<sub>yy</sub>,I<sub>zz</sub>, J, E, and G would be required. For example, see the
 element documentation regarding allowable material
input formats and how they are interpreted. The WFEM code makes no
attempt to understand these values at all. It simply loads them and
stores them where the element codes can easily find them. Element
property indices are identified by their row number. In the example
shown (See Listing <a href="#listing:example.txt">1</a>), there are two element
properties given. All elements defined later must refer to one of
these two definitions unless the element has no properties (we're
staying very flexible here.).

<p>
Nodes are defined subsequent to the
<a name="command:nodes">
</a> command. Unlike elements, the
first value on each line is the node number. This example shows some
of the flexibility of the reader in that it allows nodes to be defined
before or after the elements. In fact, you can alternately define
nodes and elements. This is convenient if you have an existing model
and would like to simply tack on an additional substructure to the
end.

<p>
Elements are defined using ` ' (in
this case ). There must exist a function
. Rows subsequent to such a command are
defined to be of that type. The definition of elements is concluded
with a blank line. Keep in mind that the main body of the finite
element code knows <em>nothing</em> about any element, so adding an
element to the code means writing a function file to do all of the
work of using the element.

<p>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.1">
2.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Units</h3>
Like any code, as long as consistent units are used, the code doesn't care what units you are using. The presumption of the code, however, is that values are entered in mks units (kilogram, meter, seconds). To assist with this, some built in constants are available for doing conversions for the user. For example, to enter 1 inch  using presuming mks units, one would instead type . Conversions from mks to th inch-pound system are not available directly, but can always be achieved by inverting the conversions. Currently defined units are  and .

<p>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.2">
2.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Defined Constants</h3>
The gravitational constant  is also defined to be 9.80665 (standard gravity is defined to be at sea level and latitude 45. 

<p>
Material propeties, E, G, <font face="symbol">r</font
>, are available instead of typing them out as the variables  (also ),  and  (also ). Others can easily be added to .

<p>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.3">
2.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Variables</h3>
Variables can also be used to define geometries.
Variables are generated by definitions (e.g. ) following
the variable command ( on a line by itself).
Variable can be defined using any lowercase letter with the
exceptions of i and j which are reserved for i=j=<font face="symbol">Ö</font>{<font face="symbol">-</font
>1}.
Variables can also be lowercase letters followed by a number. Other
variable names may be used with care. The guidelines given here are
provided to simplify selection of names. As long as the variable name
doesn't conflict with an internally used variable name, it is
acceptable to use. A warning will be generated if an illegal choice is
used.

<p>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.4">
2.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Parameters</h3>
The third, optional, argument to  is a vector of parameters that are used in the problem definition of the input file. If this vector is available, the input file may use variables  where  has a numerical value between 1 and the total length of the input parameter vector. The advantage of parameters is that multiple similar cases can be run without having to repeatedly edit the input file. For instance, 

  for i=1:10
  wfem('inputfilename.txt',[],i)
  end

would run the case defined in  to be run 10 times, with the quantity referred to as  in the input file varying between 1 and 10.

 <h2><a name="tth_sEc3">
3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Meshing</h2>
Meshing in this code is different than meshing in a traditional finite element code. In traditional finite elements, a geometry of an object is defined, the internal region of the body is divided by algorithm into elements, then  nodes are automatically generated. In WFEM, meshing is the repeating of a substructure multiple times in a one dimensional arrangement. To do this, the command  is entered.  Everything between this command and the command  is considered to be the definition of what one bay looks like. This should include <em>only</em> elements. Elements must be <em>bay capable</em>(See section <a href="#sec:elements">7</a>), as the bay meshing requires some knowledge to be obtained regarding the elements. Including non-bay capable elements will lead to erroneous results. No error checking for this exist. The  command is formated as:<br />
    
  .<br />
 Here the nodes listed in  are the innermost nodes of the unit bay, and the nodes listed in  are the outermost nodes, or free nodes. Another way to think of this is that the nodes  are currently the furthest extending nodes in what will become a series of bays. The nodes  are the starting nodes of this unit. For the next bay, the starting nodes will be .For example, the code segment:

bay element
beam3 element
1 2 1

<p>
repeat bay 3 times. Attach 1 to 2. 

will create will create a four element model of a beam by creating the first element (connecting nodes 1 and 2) then creating 3 more elements.
